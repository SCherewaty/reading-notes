who you met with
Andy Herman

how you are connected to them
Co-founder of Signtag.com.  Partner in business.

what you learned about that person and their work
Andy spends a lot of time coding in React.  He definitely prefers to do the behind-the-scenes work and leaves the customer contact for me.  
He is admittedly not great with soft skills but has put a great deal of effort into improving.  He's taken improv classes and communication
courses to support this effort.

and how you can help them.
Andy knows nothing about cybersecurity and has already taken an interest in my path.  I'll endeavor to help both of us.
