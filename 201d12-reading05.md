How can you list the files in the current directory using the command prompt?
Typing "dir" will list the files in the current directory.

How might the “sfc” command and the “gpupdate” command help in troubleshooting on Windows?
since "sfc" scans all the core files and "gpupdate" forces updates even to logged-in computers, these would be useful in 
emergency situations.

What advantages does the “robocopy” command offer over the “xcopy” command, and why is it useful for file transfers in certain situations?
Robocopy is a stronger version of xcopy.  Good for non-local links and where intermittent internet connection stops file transfers frequently.

Think about any real-life scenarios from your cultural context where the use of command line tools could be beneficial. Describe one such scenario and explain how a specific command line tool would help address the situation.

One situation I can think of is crossing the language barrier.  Users more accustomed to a specific language may find remotely working on a computer across the world is easier to navigate via the command line.
