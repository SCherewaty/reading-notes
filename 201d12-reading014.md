Malware Remediation Tools and Techniques

What are the main differences between anti-virus and anti-malware software?
Malware is a general term for software that does malicious things.  The hallmark of a virus is its ability to replicate itself and cause problems.

What are some signs or symptoms that may indicate a malware infection on your PC?
Unusual behavior, like redirection or startup issues, is the most obvious symptom.

Explain the difference between a full system scan and a quick scan when using antimalware software.
A quick scan will identify the area ther's a problem and takes only 5-20 minutes.  A full scan can take longer and offer more information and options for remediation.

What should you do if your computer is infected with ransomware?
First step is to enter SAFE MODE which should keep malicious programs from running.

Compare and contrast malware removal techniques in Windows PCs with those in other operating systems like macOS or Linux. How might these different approaches reflect the cultural values and priorities of the technology users?
We've been a mac family for over a decade.  The reason for this was the rendering useless of one of my wife's laptops from a worm released while she was a student at ASU.  Malware is written for the marketshare and windows is filthy with hack writers.
