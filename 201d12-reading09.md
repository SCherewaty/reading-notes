Readings: Workstation Deployment SOP

What is a Standard Operating Procedure (SOP), and why is it important for an organization?
SOP's are the main set (go-to) of instructions companies use for various operations.

What are the three types of documents that should be included in an SOP manual? Briefly describe each type.
Policy - High level guidance documents.
SOP - What should be done, When in the process it needs to happen and Why they're happening in the first place.
Work Instructions - For any given work task the instructions provide linear guidance.

Why are SOPs considered a primary way to implement or enforce policies in an organization?
Policies are the guardrails of a company ensuring no one goes off the road.  The actionable component are SOP's which hopefully keep everyone FAR from 
the guardrails and on-track for being productive.

What does the author emphasize regarding the audience when writing SOPs, and why is it essential to consider them?
"Readable. This means legible font sizes, numbered pages, titles, numbered paragraph headings, and effective use of whitespace.
Consumable. Using a template or predefined format makes the content easy to read.
Understandable. To be effective, SOPs must be focused and to the point, using relevant, but simple terms.
Actionable. SOPs must clearly and succinctly describe what is to be done.
Measurable. The activities described within an SOP must be specific and measurable."
