What is a computer reading assignment

How is a hardware hack different than a software hack?  
A software hack can be done in a myriad of ways including phishing, malware, scams and other vectors perpetrated remotely without having to physically touch the target.  A hardware hack is much more difficult to pull off because the perpetrator must somehow physically alter and/or affect a part of the hardware in a vestor to a target.  It's also more risky because hardware leaves a physical trail.

What are the two ways for spies to alter a computerâ€™s hardware?  
Interdiction; manipulating a device while in transit from a manufacturer to a customer.  The other way is to seed alterations directly from the manufacturer.

Explain how the hack worked.
Subcontractors (4 of them) for production of motherboards for Supermicro seeded their chips with extremely tiny and inconspicuous digital switches. These switches work seamlessly with the rest of the hardware on the motherboard to grant access to back doors to information monitored remotely by China.  Middlemen posing as Supermicro reps often bribed plant managers while requesting design changes.

How were investigators able to trace the chips back to the source?
Humnan intelligence and access to manipulated data.  Informants and following the supply chain trail in reverse.
