What is the BIOS?
The BIOS is the Basic Input Output System.  It initializes the startup and booting process and tranfers control of the hardware to the Operating System.  The BIOS retains all the factory-set information the computer needs to know to be useful.  It's like someone in a soap opera with Amnesia...they may not remember their spouse, but they still know how to eat and walk.

Use analogies from your previous background to explain what happens during the booting process?
I was the SME for Boeing's Lock Out/Tag Out ( LOTO ) procedures for the KC-46, 777 and 787 programs.  There is a whole "operating system" of mechanics wanting to get into airplanes and do their work (or redo their work not accepted by QA). The airplane would become "live" at a certain stage of assembly and a giant physical barrier was installed around the airplane keeping mechanics out and only granted access by a LOTO gate attendant. This attendant worked closely with Functional testers (testing powered systems, landing gear, ailerons...etc.) to keep both the airplane and the mechanics clamoring to get in, safe.  The LOTO attendant is like the BIOS, which works with the CMOS (functional testers) to grant or deny access to a powered platform.  The LOTO attendant is required by law, so non-volatile.  The functional testers are transient, so, volatile.  Higher level decisions about what operations will be taking place happen at the LOTO gate before access to the airplance is granted.  This is similar to how the BIOS and CMOS work together to transfer control to the Operating System.

What is the “Power On Self Test”?
The Power On Self Test is run by the BIOS to make sure all the necessary components for nominal function of the computer are in place and working properly.

What is the CMOS?
Complimentary Metal Oxide Semiconductor.  The CMOS chip stores volatile data used by the operating system on startup. 

What is the CMOS battery?
The CMOS battery is the CR2032 lithium battery (in most machines) that keeps a tiny but constant current applied to the CMOS chips in order to retain data even when the machine is turned off.


## Things I want to know more about
More about amnesia...
Is there a way to physically bypass the BIOS with an external device?
