We'll be doing a lot of work with shell applications in the course of this curriculum because it allows access to the heart of the system withou the need for a fancy user interface.

What is the primary function of a shell in a computerâ€™s operating system?  
To give the user access to the computer under a variety of circumstances.

How does Bash locate and execute commands on a Linux or Unix system?
Commands are stored by default in system directories and Bash is able to look up commands.  Through Bash a user can issue a command and if it exists in the system directory Bash will find and execute it.

How can you determine if your system is running a Bash shell?
You can use the ECHO function.  

What makes Bash scripting powerful and why is it considered scriptable?
"One reason Bash (and Linux in general) is considered so powerful is because it's scriptable. Anything you can type into Bash manually, you can also list in a plain-text file and have Bash run it for you. Instead of spending an afternoon manually running a hundred commands, you can script the commands and have your computer execute them while you tend to more important matters. Because nearly everything on Linux runs on top of the Bash shell, nearly everything on Linux can be scripted through Bash."

Bash scripting allows for customization, automation, and efficiency. Discuss methods or practices from your previous work experience or cultural background that aim to achieve similar goals in daily tasks.
A lot of previous experience is in website design through platforms like squarespace.  What's described reminds me of a blank website template that can be easily customized with various features being plugged-in here and there.
