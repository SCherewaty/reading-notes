System Restore:  This is a super relevant topic for IT and cybersecurity professionals because while we're dabbling in risky software and logic maneuvers we're prone to breaking, infecting or at least affecting various states of the virtual machines we're working with.  System restore/snapshots allows us to save states for before and after making changes.  Save, restore and backup things happening inside the machine.
