What are the five main sections included in the Windows Defender Security Center, and what functionalities do they offer?
-Virus and threat protection
-Device performance and health
-Firewall and network protection
-App and browser control
-Family options


What information does the “Device performance & health” section provide, and how can you access it?
Anything that may need attention for the protection, performance and enhancement of the device itself.  It covers battery life and storage as well as malfunctioning drivers.  These
are all things that affect performance but do not fall under the heading of "security".

How does the Windows Defender Security Center notify you of issues that require your attention?
A shield icon with an exclamation point shows up over the ailing section on the users dashboard.

What features are managed under the “Firewall & network protection” section in the Windows Defender Security Center?
Public and private networks.  This provides a gate through which only selected apps and users are able to pass.

How does the concept of “security” in Windows Defender Security Center relate to your own experiences in keeping your personal belongings safe? Share some strategies you use to protect your belongings and how they might parallel the security measures used in the digital world.
I think we compartmentalize our physical items in a similar manner that windows comparmentalizes digital info.  The physical construction of my home is a good example:  There are some of my things outside my house (bird baths, garden items, potted trees) that are essentially "public"; meaning I can't really stop a motivated jerk from just grabbing and stealing them while I sleep. I know the risks and I'm cool with it.  My shed outside is inside my back fence, which is unlocked, but IT IS closed and locked with a small frail lock.  It's harder for the jerk to grab anything out of there but it wouldn't take much to break in....again, nothing expensive in there so I'm reasonably cool with the risk.  There's expensive equipment in my garage, I would very much not be cool with a break in, but its much harder to break into without alerting me and my dog.  And finally, the most expensive, irreplacable and precious items in my home are the living things inside and our memories.  These are actively, and agressively defended.  Not only are the locks and brick construction the most difficult to breach...breacking them drastically increases the risk the attackers.  No quarter is given to anyone who is dedicated enough to take a risk like that because at that point their intent to do malicious harm is no longer in question. Similar policies should be enacted for malicious harm in the digital world.
