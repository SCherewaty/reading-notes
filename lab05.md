Explain the terms “shell”, “terminal”, “cli”, and “command prompt”. Why are these still used today, when we have graphical interfaces?
In the words of a software dev I know, using the command line is like "cutting to the chase".  It's of course useful when the use of a mouse isn't available but you can take action on multiple files at once.  

What are the commands to change directories, list the file’s contents and rename/move files?
Change directory = cd [path]
List contents = ls
Move file and rename = mv

What are relative and absolute paths? What is special about starting with a ~ (tilde) or a ‘/’ character in the path?
A direct path going from the directory to a file is an absolute path. The forward slash denotes an absolute path.
a path going to a directory from the current directory is a relative path.
An analog to this is a cross country trip.  You are absolutely going from Seattle to New York.  At some point though, you will be in chicago driving toward Minneapolis.
