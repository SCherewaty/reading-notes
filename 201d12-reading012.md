Reflect on the importance of cultural awareness in the field of network security and administration. How might cultural differences influence decision-making and problem-solving when dealing with virtual routers and firewalls, like pfSense, in a global context?
Some cultures are more communal and treat data the way they treat public spaces, some with reverence and some with blatant disregard for personal privacy.  Honestly, I think culturally, it comes down to what's available and how much it costs.  Across the globe and across all cultures, it almost always comes down to cost.  For example, a hotel in an area where state-of-the-art resources are scarce may only be concerned with providing wifi to their guests even if it's not secure.  A 5 star hotel in New York, however, would be much more concerned (and may spare no expense) for their guests.
