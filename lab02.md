Which is better in a CPU, more cores or higher speed?  Under which circumstances is that true? 
More cores for different processing jobs, different threads.  Higher speed per core enables maximum performance per thread.

How many CPU cores does a computer need?
That greatly depends on what we're doing with it.  One core is enough to manage text and documents..but not for gaming.  Word on the street is that we should stick to 6...for now.

What details are you looking for when finding a motherboard which fits your processor?
Price, compatibility and upgradability.  Also, we should ensure it's got onboard WiFi, bluetooth, enough RAM slots and graphics card slots.

What are the tradeoffs you’d evaluate while selecting a storage device?
The faster the RAM the less strain on the CPU.  However, there are internal limits to the amount of RAM a given computer can use and still reap benefits.

Think about others with a background similar to yours. How would you explain to them the key parts of a computer, in a way they’d best connect with?
I think I'd compare it to a restaurant:
The kitchen is the motherboard - lots of things happen in the kitchen; servers, QA, chefs, prep cooks and even hosts are in and out all the time
The a single CPU core is a chef...there are limits to what this one chef may serve in an hour.  However, 6 chefs are FAR more productive and able to focus on different tasks.
The RAM is the QA managers and the servers providing constantly flucuating orders and feedback on those orders to the CPU chefs
The walk-in cold storage fridge/freezer is actually the power.  If there's no food, there's no reason for any of the staff to be there.  The restaurant is dead in the water.


## Things I want to know more about
Graphics cards - aren't they also a type of processor?
How are motherboards mapped out?
